What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git file which is used to track the various versions created of all the files in that repository and makes this the master branch

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains the files that WILL be committed to the repository.. whereas the working directory contains ALL the files in that dir which neednt all be a part of the repository yet..
